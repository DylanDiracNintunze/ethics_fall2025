This page is meant for you to showcase your case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on our readings. You will need to update the content in each section and submit your site to Moodle (see calendar). Once all sections are updated, revise this paragraph so it summarizes the purpose of your site for new visitors. This can include how to navigate it, what each section contains, and what someone should understand about your work just by reading this introduction.


About Me

My name is Dylan-Dirac Nintunze. Iâ€™m a Computer Science student in the [Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) at St. Olaf College. I'm earning my B.A in Computer Science with a Data Science concentration. <!--- You can also talk about internships you've had [if applicable] -->

Research

Topics I am currently interested in researching include: Mobile Computing and Artificial Intelligence. In this ethics class, I would love to learn more about the ethical implications of making mobile applications targetted towards the youth.

Personal Life

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching movies and documentaries. On rare occasions I leave my house, I enjoy running and going on walks in the natural lands.
