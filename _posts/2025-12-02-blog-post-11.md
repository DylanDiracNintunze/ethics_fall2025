**Case Study:**  
[Complete Delete: In Practice, Clicking 'Delete' Rarely Deletes. Should it?](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/fesqymtr/release/3?readingCollection=ca73f7c0)

Today's case study delves into one of the most critical issues when talking about data privacy. The Delete button rarely deletes the data that the user wants deleted. In some cases, this is a negative impact to the user as they truly want the data gone forever. In other cases, the act of not really deleting the data can be a lifesaver if the user changes their mind and comes back to recover the data. This whole complication is a result of modern computer systems getting more and more sophisticated and it is now up to the system designers to decide what the Delete button actually does.

In this blog, I am going to discuss questions that can help us cope and adapt in this new environment of modern computer systems. There are ways in which these systems fail but there are also ways in which they excel. One of the most obvious ways in which they commonly fail is not telling users that there are remnant data on their systems. This begs the question: What approaches should they use to inform their users of the existence of such data on their systems? The answer to this question is a challenging one in my opinion. The reason this is the case is because the existence of such data 'on their systems' defeats the purpose of the Delete button in the first place. With this in mind, whatever approach we can think of should not appear straight after the user clicks the Delete button because would be confusing rather than bring clarity to how the sytem is operating. The idea that comes to mind is to redesign the Delete button and make it say something like 'Trash it' to signify that your data is heading somewhere you can you can go back to but only for a limited time before the garbage company comes and tosses it away forever. This approach seems the most sensible to me if we are designing a system that does not delete the data forever. However, if we want the system to completely delete the data, using a specific verb like 'Delete' or 'Erase' would do just fine as long as we are sure the data is truly gone forever.
