## Abstract

This case study aims to explore design features of some of the most-used apps worldwide and what makes them addictive. I will look at psychological and economic concepts that influence the choice of app designers when making addictive apps and the impact of excessive apps usage on mental health. The general points of this case study will include concepts definition related to app development, design and mental health and a brief overview of the design process of an app.

For my first audience, app users, I will include an overview of online addictive behavior and the most notable causes of such behavior that stem from the apps themselves. After that, I will discuss the concept of addiction and some practical ways to deal with it. [Go to the Stakeholder1 page to learn more.](Stakeholder_1/)

For my second audience, the app developers, I will discuss the mental health impacts of addictive apps on their users and how their design choices feed into online addictive behavior. After that, I will go into current regulations that aim to curb the detrimental effects of excessive use of online apps. Finally, I will go into how society is being impacted by online addiction for them to understand that they might meet with the consequences as well.

For my third audience, the relatives of those addicted, I will present ways to offer help to their closed ones as well as ways to spot when an addiction might be evolving into something worse such as causing harm to oneself or others. Finally, I will present some of the healthy alternatives that they can encourage those directly affected to take instead. [Go to the Stakeholder3 page to learn more](stakeholder3/)
