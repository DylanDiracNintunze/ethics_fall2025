Companies are increasingly using AI to hire new employees. AI that is not properly trained can carry on biases and have a negative impact into the company retention of its employees.

**News Article:**  
[When Your Job Interviewer Isnâ€™t Human](https://time.com/7306955/ai-job-interview-recruitment/)

In today's blog, I will be presenting an article that discusses the use of AI during the recruitment process of employees. The article basically argues that if companies keep using AI during the interview process, they could later struggle with retaining employees who did not a proper introduction into the company culture.

**Task 2**

Below is a dissection of that argument into premises that lead to its conclusion:
P1: Jobseekers would rather talk to a human to experience that human connection.
P2: The AI experience is alienating and often biased.
C: Using AI is bad because it can affect employees retention since they are not properly introduced to the company culture.

**Task 3**

P1 Challenge: AIs are getting increasingly sohpisticated to mimic human speech and behavior so to feel the human connection does not require talking to a human.
P2 Challenge: The bias is largely due to the fact that the AI used is a general LLM that was trained on random internet data rather than on specific company data.
New Conclusion: Using AI is not inherently bad but using general Large Language Models without training it on the right data is.

**Task 4**

Using AI to recruit new emplyees can help companies be more efficient in their recruitment processes and still give recruits a specific inside view into the company they are interviewing with.
