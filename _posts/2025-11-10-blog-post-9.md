**Case Study:**  
[Censorship of Misinformation and Freedom of Speech on Social Media](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/lkf63cu5/release/1)

Today's case study strives to combat a widely adopted culture of censorship in digital media. The case study pushes to think about how today's misinformation is not something that came out of blue but that it is a symptom of a much deeper issue that has been brewing for quite sometime.

In this blog, I am going to hold a discussion of some of the great reflective questions posed at the end of the case study and then I will introduce my own after.

In the case study, there is a critical assertion that misinformation appears to be worse now that it was in the past. I completely agree with this and the first example that comes to mind is the large presence of misogynistic discourse on social media targetted towards the youth most of the time. These discourse are a society-wide issue that take advantage of young men in their developmental stages of life without much experience already. With an increasingly younger society we have, this type of misinformation proves to be a big threat especially when it leads to toxic masculinity and a disregard of men's mental health.

The case study also discusses several institutions that have helped to disseminate reliable information. They are praised on how effective they are in establishing order to the information ecosystem. However in today's age of internet, there are numerous sources of knowledge on the internet with regards to professional skill development. A lot of online platform that offer courses on various topics usually do not present opportunities for critical thinking and they often provide content that is easily digestible and meant to be consumed in one go. Although these sources of knowledge increase the reach of information to various parts of the world, especially to those not fortunate enough to attend traditional academic institutions, they fail to convey the essential skills to the pursuit of knowledge. Skills such as critical thinking, and active learning. These platforms can push their audience to undermine how much it takes to become an expert in something.

One of the questions I genuinely like asks if there are some things that I can truly know by myself without relying on the trustworthiness of other people or institutions. I think this part knowledge is very limited. An example I can give is things like how I feel or the effects of external factors on my body. I think I can access and truly know this type of information just by myself without any other intermediary.
