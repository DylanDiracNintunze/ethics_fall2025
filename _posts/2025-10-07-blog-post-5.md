[Databite No. 156: Hierarchy | Generative AI's Labor Impacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlSpKtZ48h0&list=PLYrf5LyVCF1Nk28nRu8lcCIxtAH3iVGDj&index=7)

In today's segment, I will be discussing the impacts on GenAI on labor based on the DataBite's talk about the hierarchy in AI industry's labor force.

The talk brought together subject matter experts in the AI industry, poeple who have a professional experience working with GenAI or who have interacted with the behind-the-scenes workers who are making AI what it is today. The first speaker is Mila Miceli, a researcher whose focus is on labor conditions and power asymmetries in the outsourced data workers examining their impact on ML and data sets. Her perspectives come from years of engagement with privatized data workers from the global south. The second speker is Russell Brandon, a tech editor for the Rest of The World news outlet. His background is in reporting tech news and writing special segments on emerging tech. Last but not least, we have John Lopez, a writer and filmmaker. His perspectives come from somebody whose work heavily collides with what GenAI is trying to accomplish. A lot of his and colleagues' data has been used to train AI systems without accountability from the AI companies.

The overall aim of the talk is to give voice to those who are already doing the work in making GenAIa reality and those most impacted. The speakers really help us understand better what has led to the current of state of AI and its workforce and what invisible systems and hierarchies are scaffolding the situation and what might be coming next.
