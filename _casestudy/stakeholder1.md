## Recognizing Online Addictive Behavior

Some of the most notable signs that show that somebody is addicted to their phone include:

* Compulsive checking

* Losing track of time

* Difficulty disengaging

* Anxiety when disconnected from the online world

One study conducted in a Chinese university found that only 25% of users self-report problematic behaviors, especially in short-video, gaming, and social networking apps. This highlights a very important issue where it gets even harder to ask for help once you are addicted to the digital realm.

## How App Features Trigger Addiction

Some design features that heavily impact user behavior include:

* Streaks and progress meters.

An example of this is Snapchat's snapstreaks, a feature that track progress of how often friends share messages and pictures. Once the snapscore has gone up significantly, it gets very hard to not miss Snapchat even a signle day as you have to start from scratch otherwise.

* Social comparison.

This is commonly seen in social media apps that allow users to give updates to others about their lives and share pictures. There is allways the feeling that somebody else is doing better than you simply because of a picture they posted in a while.


* Variable rewards.

This iss like when somebody is gambling. For example on Instagram, the more likes you get by posting a story the more you are determined to post again to chase the same feeling that you have only just tasted a little.

## Understanding Addiction

Behavioral addiction manifests itself through some sort of halo effect. It all starts with incentives that are put in place by app designers to exploit the wiring of your brain (3). From then on, your brain prooduces a response in the form of constant and irresistible checking, which when unchecked then goes on for hours each day until you cannot help yoursel but open that app every now and then.

## Practical Strategies for Users

Here are some practical steps that one can take on their own in order to fight PSU:

* Turn off nonessential notifications.

* Set screen-free zones or hours (nighttime, meals).

* Use digital well-being tools to track time.

* Remove apps that exploit streaks or fear-of-missing-out.

* Practice intentional usage like scheduling check-in times.

These strategies can help mitigate the constant loops, as Alter describes, the "impulse to check" aand the anxiety that is caused by always-on connectivity. (3)
