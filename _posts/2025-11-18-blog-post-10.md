**Case Study:**  
[ARTificial: Why Copyright Is Not the Right Policy Tool to Deal with Generative AI](https://yalelawjournal.org/forum/artificial-why-copyright-is-not-the-right-policy-tool-to-deal-with-generative-ai)

Todays's case study takes us in the legal wonderland of GAI ethics, specifically how AI-genrated contents might make it even harder to apply copyright laws in the technological realm, an area that has already caused enormous expansion of the copyright doctrine.

The author explores the legal and philosophical dimensions that AI-generated content poses by answering to a number of questions that I will go into detail below. The main idea that the author explores is the difference between GAI and human content in asserting what is creative work and what is not.

To begin, the author focuses on how artists whose work is used to train AI should be compensated and in what circumstances. Compensating artists for the outputs that AI gives is complicated in the sense that the AI systems need an unimaginable amount if data to become fully functional. The dilemma that the author raises is how do we know which artist deserves compensation per output from billions of data?
In my opinion, we need to think about compensation in a completely different way when it comes to artists whose work is being funnelled into AI models. I think what needs to happen is for the artists to be compensated in terms of shares of the AI companies they have helped build. However, I realize that the proposed method is a bit of a far reach in today's capitalist world. The authors have little power because the big corporations take away the profits of their work. A practical step that can help steer into the right direction where the authors are properly compensated would be to unionize in order to make their voices heard. In rerms of the circumstances in which authors should be compensated, I think this depends on how influential their work is for a specific element of culture. This can be either in terms of quantity or quality. Quantity for example if as a photographer, you have contributed a large number of puictures that are then used to train image generation models. Quality-wise, we can consider specific works that are iconic in our society such as the Monalisa. Even if it is just one piece of art, it still holds a great value in what is considered an artistic painting.
