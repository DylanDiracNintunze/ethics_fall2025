**Case Study:**  
[The Right to Be an Exception to a Data-Driven Rule](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/right-to-be-exception/release/2)

**Summary**

The case study aims to provide a framework that can be used in deciding whether a data-driven rule should be employed rather than a human one in critical decision making. The case study focuses on three main components in coming up with the new framework: individualization, uncertainty, and harm.

**Discussion Questions Answers**

*Answer 1*

A data-driven rule is a directive that results from pre-trained algorithms that often give a score to a question, like, is somebody more likely to commit a crime again? based on previvous data that it has been fed.
A data-driven exception is when the rule does not apply to a specific subject because it possesses way more covariates than what the algorithm has been fed with.
An exception is not the same as an error because error means that the algorithm is giving straight up wrong information based on preconceived data whereas in the case of an exception the algorithm does not even have enough data to judge a specific subject.

*Answer 2*

Human decisions are way more context-dependent than data-driven ones will ever be. For example, a human recruiter is very quick to see the attractiveness of a resume and can use that to judge if a candidate is suitable or not for the role of UX/UI design. It would be, on the other way, harder to make an algorithm judge whether a resume is more attractive than another.
Data-driven decisions, on another note, if accurate and precise, can be applied a large set of subjects in an instant of time in the way that human ones cannot. For example, if I am a recruiter and I am looking for a backend developer who has basic Python programming skills, it is easy to build an algorithm that scan the thousands of resumes I have gotten and rank them from longer to shorter Python programming experience. A human would take months to go through all thousands of resumes and rank them.

*Answer 3*

The benefits of individualization include the reduction of bias in the data-driven decision that are being made. It forces the decision makers to really consider a vast majority of covariates before attempting to assign a general rule to a diverse population. The downside of it that is not really discussed is the risk of transforming really fast algorithms into really slow ones because of the increase of factors that the algorithms now have to take into consideration.

*Answer 4*

I feel like when the stakes are high, whatever evaluation metric we use to justify the use of a data-driven rule better have a success rate of 100%. So far I have not come across such a metric so I would say no for the sake of preserving the spirit of the case study that states that each individual should have the right to be an exception. Uncertainty is so critical when the decision is irreversible in the future.

**New Question**

The right to be an exception is such a critical law in today's society that is very biased. How can you see this same rule or derivatives of it applied into different sectors of life or technologies. Can you come up with other laws that can relate closely to it?

The reason I chose this question is because how today's societies need a lot of ethical thinkers in different walks of life and how technology has quietly become the backbone of society for as long as we have lived on this earth. I think the above question helps explore the legal aspect of data-driven decisions in the reading.

**Reflection**

This exercise has helped me realize how technology can be biased in the name of simplicity and how that bias can lead to irreversible damage. It has made me to be more compassionate especially to the ones I would normally consider as \'other\'.
