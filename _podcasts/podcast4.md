Monday, on his way to work, Paul's Tesla gets hacked and the hackers take full control of the car denying him any access whatsoever. They drive him all around Minneapolis to the point where he is late to work. Adding onto that, they jam his signals as well so he can’t reach out for help to the outside world. He is late to a very important meeting with his boss. Finally, when the battery is about to die. They make his car do burnouts in the middle of the road causing multiple accidents and injuries.
